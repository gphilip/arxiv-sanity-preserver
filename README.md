# Arxiv Browser for Data Structures and Algorithms

This is code for a web interface to [arXiv][arXiv] articles on
Data Structures and Algorithms ([cs.DS][cs.DS]). One can use this
to keep track of recent papers in cs.DS, search for papers, sort
papers by similarity to a paper, see recent popular papers, add
papers to a personal library, and get personalized recommendations
of (new or old) cs.DS papers on arXiv.

This project is currently live at <http://arxiv.gphilip.in>. 

## The code

This is based on code by [Andrej Karpathy][karpathy] with *very* minor
modifications, such as :

 - Restricting the domain to cs.DS
 - Small changes to the template
 - Minor fixes to work with Python 3

See [the original project page][arxivSanityPreserver] for more
details on the code, including instructions on installing,
customizing, and running it.

Many thanks to Andrej Karpathy for making his code available!
